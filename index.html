        <h3 class="intro">About Me</h3>
        <p class ="intro">
            A native of Provo, UT, I spent most of my life growing up around BYU. 
            When I was younger, I would go to the HBLL library on campus with my 
            friends and we would all log onto the computers to play games with each 
            other. After serving a full-time mission in Frankfurt, Germany, I returned 
            to Utah and enrolled at BYU. I sampled a few majors and eventually picked my 
            favorite: Computer Science. I have been married for a year and enjoy spending 
            time with my wife. We travel together, watch movies together, and you get 
            the idea. When I'm not doing school work, or working, I'm hanging out with friends 
            and working on projects of my own. Lately, some friends of mine have been designing 
            boardgames and we have been meeting together to test them. My plans for the future include 
            moving to a nicer apartment, owning a dog, starting a family (down the road), and 
            getting a job in my own field.
